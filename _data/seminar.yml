  title: Efficient computation of geometry for structural analysis of large molecular systems
  abstract: >
    The Solvent-Excluded Surface (SES) is an essential representation of molecules which is massively used in molecular modeling and drug discovery since it represents the interacting surface between molecules. Based on its properties, it supports the visualization of both large scale shapes and details of molecules. While several methods targeted its computation, the ability to process large molecular structures to address the introduction of big complex analysis while leveraging the massively parallel architecture of GPUs has remained a challenge. This is mostly caused by the need for consequent memory allocation or by the complexity of the parallelization of its processing. In this paper, we leverage the last theoretical advances made for the depiction of the SES to provide fast analytical computation with low impact on memory. We show that our method is able to compute the complete surface while handling large molecular complexes with competitive computation time costs compared to previous works.

  title: Numerical Methods for Kernel Slicing
  abstract: >
    Kernels are key in machine learning for modeling interactions. Unfortunately, brute-force computation of the related kernel sums scales quadratically with the number of samples. Recent Fourier-slicing methods lead to an improved linear complexity, provided that the kernel can be sliced and its Fourier coefficients are known. To obtain these coefficients, we view the slicing relation as an inverse problem and present two algorithms for their recovery. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our methods.

  title: A discussion of the minus distance kernel
  abstract: >
    Methods based on the Gaussian kernel are popular in machine learning and imaging sciences.
    But over the last decade, several works have highlighted the "minus distance" kernel $k(x,y) = -\|x-y\|$ as a better baseline in many settings: this formula does not rely on a scale parameter, can be implemented efficiently via random 1D projections and defines a gradient flow with global convergence properties. It induces the well-known "Energy Distance" in statistics and "thin plate splines" model for 3D shape registration. On the other hand, technical difficulties arise when one must consider the splitting of particle masses or distributions with varying total masses.
    So is the "minus distance" kernel ready for widespread use in shape analysis?
    To answer this question, we will begin with a 20-minute presentation by François-Xavier Vialard, followed by an open discussion moderated by Joan Glaunès.

  title: Multicellular simulations with shape and volume constraints using optimal transport
  abstract: >
    Many living and physical systems such as cell aggregates, tissues or bacterial colonies behave as unconventional systems of particles that are strongly constrained by volume exclusion and shape interactions. Understanding how these constraints lead to macroscopic self-organized structures is a fundamental question in e.g. developmental biology. To this end, various types of computational models have been developed. Here, we introduce a new framework based on optimal transport theory to model particle systems with arbitrary dynamical shapes and deformability properties. Our method builds upon the pioneering work of Brenier on incompressible fluids and its recent applications to materials science. It lets us specify the shapes and volumes of individual cells and supports a wide range of interaction mechanisms, while automatically taking care of the volume exclusion constraint at an affordable numerical cost. We showcase the versatility of this approach by reproducing several classical systems in computational biology. Our Python code is freely available at https://iceshot.readthedocs.io

  title: Untangling vascular trees for surgery and interventional radiology
  abstract: >
    The diffusion of minimally invasive, endovascular interventions motivates the development of visualization methods for complex vascular networks. We propose a planar representation of blood vessel trees which preserves the properties that are most relevant to catheter navigation: topology, length and curvature. Taking as input a three-dimensional digital angiography, our algorithm produces a faithful two-dimensional map of the patient's vessels within a few seconds. To this end, we propose optimized implementations of standard morphological filters and a new recursive embedding algorithm that preserves the global orientation of the vascular network. We showcase our method on peroperative images of the brain, pelvic and knee artery networks. On the clinical side, our method simplifies the choice of devices prior to and during the intervention. This lowers the risk of failure during navigation or device deployment and may help to reduce the gap between expert and common intervention centers. From a research perspective, our method simulates the cadaveric display of artery trees from anatomical dissections. This opens the door to large population studies on the branching patterns and tortuosity of fine human blood vessels. Our code is released under the permissive MIT license as part of the scikit-shapes Python library.

  title: Normalizing Diffusion Kernels with Optimal Transport
  abstract: >
    Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself, with applications to shape analysis and matching.

  title: Reproducing kernel methods for machine learning, PDEs, and statistics with Python
  abstract: >
    This monograph offers an introduction to a collection of numerical algorithms implemented in the library CodPy (an acronym that stands for the Curse Of Dimensionality in PYthon), which has found widespread applications across various areas, including machine learning, statistics, and computational physics. We develop here a strategy based on the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and the theory of optimal transport. Initially designed for mathematical finance, this library has since been enhanced and broadened to be applicable to problems arising in engineering and industry. In order to present the general principles and techniques employed in CodPy and its applications, we have structured this monograph into two main parts. First of all, we focus on the fundamental principles of kernel-based representations of data and solutions, also that the presentation therein is supplemented with illustrative examples only. Next, we discuss the application of these principles to many classes of concrete problems, spanning from the numerical approximation of partial differential equations to (supervised, unsupervised) machine learning, extending to generative methods with a focus on stochastic aspects.

  title: Representing and Mapping 3D Imaging and Spatial-omics Data Simultaneously Across Scales with Image-Varifold
  abstract: >
    Advancements in imaging and molecular techniques enable the collection of subcellular-scale data. Diversity in measured features, resolution, and physical scope of capture across technologies and experimental protocols pose numerous challenges to integrating data with reference coordinate systems and across scales.     
    This presentation describes a collection of technologies, using LDDMM (non rigid deformation) and varifold-based distance (to compare data), that we have developed for mapping data across scales and modalities, such as genes to tissues (2D or 3D).    
    The dedicated `xmodmap` python package include (i) an explicit censored data representation for the partial matching problem mapping whole brains to subsampled subvolumes, (ii) a multi, scale-space optimization technology for generating resampling grids optimized to represent spatial geometry at fixed complexities, and (iii) mutual-information based functional feature selection.     
    Finally, we will discuss practical strategies for managing peta-scale data, including tiling, sharding (multi-GPU processing), and multi-scale approaches.

    In this presentation, we will discuss my post-doctoral project, which aims to perform longitudinal registration of brains with glioblastomas on MRI images with values in the simplex - seen as probability vectors. We will begin by describing the metamorphoses on the simplex and their implementation using the Fisher-Rao metric. We will also detail the optimisation work required to perform these calculations on images of adequate resolution. Our approach includes the use of Torch checkpoints as well as a review of the L-BFGS algorithm. Finally, as a perspective, we will discuss a data-driven strategy to achieve these registrations on these specific data.

  title: Decorrelation of vector fields with speed of varifolds
  abstract: >
    To perform a registration task, various types of diffeomorphic deformations can be combined to leverage their intrinsic properties (e.g., scales, linearity) or to incorporate prior knowledge (e.g., modules). To have a better interpretability of the model and to prevent the overlapping of the two types of deformations, their action on a shape have to be as "orthogonal" as possible. We introduce a quantification of the correlation between two deformations as the difference of the speeds of a varifold associated to a shape in the direction of both vector fields representing the two deformations.

  title: Volumetric ultrasound localization microscopy
  abstract: >
    Ultrasound imaging is a widely used medical technique sensitive to blood flow. However, it is limited by a classic tradeoff between penetration and resolution. In particular, brain imaging and ultrasound angiography are compromised by the skull, which attenuates the acoustic waves, especially those that could provide submillimeter details.
    Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is a technique that provides very high-resolution depth imaging in tissues. It relies on clinical contrast agents, called microbubbles, which are isolated and localized at the micrometer scale in ultrasound images. Tracking their trajectories can provide blood speeds in the microcirculation. This technique has been demonstrated in the brain (Errico et al. Nature 2015), as well as in the kidney, tumors, peripheral vessels and lymph nodes, in both humans and animals (see the review in Couture et al. IEEE UFFC 2018, Christensen-Jeffries et al. UMB 2020 or Song et al. "Super-resolution ultrasound microvascular imaging: Is it ready for clinical use?" 2023).
    During this presentation, we will describe recent advances in ULM. In particular, we will show the three-dimensional reconstruction of the rat brain hemodynamics at the micrometer scale. A full-brain angiography at this scale will also be presented. We will discuss its application for the differentiation of strokes and its transfer to the clinical domain through intermediate experiments on the sheep brain and two-dimensional ULM with clinical ultrasound devices. All these developments aim to create a new imaging tool for stroke patients in intensive care, potentially reducing treatment time for ischemic patients.
    We will also describe recent developments in kidney imaging, where ULM offers new perspectives on the functional units of the organ, namely the nephron and its glomeruli, in both humans and animals. In the future, ULM could enable depth angiography at a scale currently only achievable through invasive modalities.

  title: How the evolution of 3D imaging methods helps us to understand hominin evolution
  abstract: >
    Since the 19th century, the study of human evolution has mostly been based on the study of morphological variation observed in the fossil record. The use of "classic" paleoanthropological approaches using linear measurements and visual descriptions has now moved to the three-dimensional quantification of size and shape thanks to the development of virtual imaging approaches. Since the first use of X-ray microtomography on a hominin tooth in 2004, the field of virtual paleoanthropology has successfully grown and has become state-of-the-art for the study of the external and internal structure of fossil teeth and bones. In parallel, geometric morphometric approaches became a standard method to finely characterize morphological variation and, coupled with statistical methods, improve our understanding of hominin evolution. This presentation will show a few examples of application of 3D imaging techniques that contributed to resolving scientific questions related to hominin diversity and their evolutionary trajectories.

  title: Lightweight curvature estimation on point clouds with randomized corrected curvature measures
  abstract: >
    The estimation of differential quantities on oriented point cloud is a classical step for many geometry processing tasks in computer graphics and vision. Even if many solutions exist to estimate such quantities, they usually fail at satisfying both a stable estimation with theoretical guarantee, and the efficiency of the associated algorithm. Relying on the notion of corrected curvature measures designed for surfaces, the method introduced in this paper meets both requirements. Given a point of interest and a few nearest neighbours, our method estimates the whole curvature tensor information by generating random triangles within these neighbours and normalising the corrected curvature measures by the corrected area measure. We provide a stability theorem showing that our pointwise curvatures are accurate and convergent, provided the noise in position and normal information has a variance smaller than the radius of neighbourhood. Experiments and comparisons with the state-of-the-art confirm that our approach is more accurate and much faster than alternatives. The method is fully parallelizable, requires only one nearest neighbour request per point of computation, and is trivial to implement.

  title: On the global convergence of Wasserstein gradient flow of the Coulomb discrepancy
  abstract: >
    In this work, we study the Wasserstein gradient flow of the Riesz energy defined on the space of probability measures. The Riesz kernels define a quadratic functional on the space of measure which is not in general geodesically convex in the Wasserstein geometry, therefore one cannot conclude to global convergence of the Wasserstein gradient flow using standard arguments. Our main result is the exponential convergence of the flow to the minimizer on a closed Riemannian manifold under the condition that the logarithm of the source and target measures are Hölder continuous. To this goal, we first prove that the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality is satisfied for sufficiently regular solutions. The key regularity result is the global in-time existence of Hölder solutions if the initial and target data are Hölder continuous, proven either in Euclidean space or on a closed Riemannian manifold. For general measures, we prove using flow interchange techniques that there is no local minima other than the global one for the Coulomb kernel. In fact, we prove that a Lagrangian critical point of the functional for the Coulomb (or Energy distance) kernel is equal to the target everywhere except on singular sets with empty interior. In addition, singular enough measures cannot be critical points. [Link to the preprint.](https://hal.science/hal-04282762v1)

  title: Topological analysis of massive datasets

    Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a recent area of computer science that focuses on discovering intrinsic structures hidden in data. Based on sound mathematical foundations such as Morse theory and Persistent Homology, TDA enables the robust extraction of the main features of a dataset into stable, concise, and multi-scale descriptors that facilitate data analysis and interpretation. In this talk, I will give an intuitive overview of the main tools used in TDA, and I will illustrate their application in a concrete use-case in computational fluid dynamics. This talk will be illustrated with results produced with the "Topology ToolKit" (TTK), an open-source library (BSD license) that we develop with collaborators to showcase our research. Tutorials for re-producing these experiments are available on the [TTK website](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/).

  title: Repulsive Shells
  abstract: >
    This paper develops a shape space framework for collision-aware geometric modeling, where basic geometric operations automatically avoid interpenetration. Shape spaces are a powerful tool for surface modeling, shape analysis, nonrigid motion planning, and animation, but past formulations permit nonphysical intersections. Our framework augments an existing shape space using a repulsive energy such that collision avoidance becomes a first-class property, encoded in the Riemannian metric itself. In turn, tasks like intersection-free shape interpolation or motion extrapolation amount to simply computing geodesic paths via standard numerical algorithms. To make optimization practical, we develop an adaptive collision penalty that prevents mesh self-intersection, and converges to a meaningful limit energy under refinement. The final algorithms apply to any category of shape, and do not require a dataset of examples, training, rigging, nor any other prior information. For instance, to interpolate between two shapes we need only a single pair of meshes with the same connectivity. We evaluate our method on a variety of challenging examples from modeling and animation.

  title: Harnessing geometric information for calculating protein structures and exploring conformational space of disordered proteins
  abstract: >
    Structural bioinformatics plays an increasingly important role in the prediction and calculation of biopolymer structures, leading to a better definition of their function. In addition, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDR) are at the center of numerous regulation and control pathways in the cell, and attract consequently extreme interest nowadays in structural biology. The optimization problem that arises for protein structure determination is more complex for such objects as the convergence criterion is more difficult to set up and the size of the conformational space is a obstacle to exhaustive exploration. The threading-augmented interval Branch-and-Prune (TAiBP), based on a reformulation of the Distance Geometry Problem (DGP), provides a theoretical frame for the fast generation of protein conformations, avoiding the combinatorial explosion of the Branch-and-Prune approach due to exponential complexity. ([1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-018-0635-0), [2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00215)) The TAiBP pipeline was applied to a several disordered proteins ([3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96370-z), [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21648-9), [5](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-38299-4_55)) and a Gaussian mixture approach RamaMix has been developed for the quantification of IDP conformations from the global distributions of backbone torsion angles.

  title: A right-invariant setting for large deformations model, and applications to matching problems
  abstract: >
    This talk will be divided in two parts. First we will study the extension of LDDMM framework to continuous actions of right half-Lie groups equipped with a right invariant sub-Riemannian metric. This generalizes work from Arguillere on the sub-Riemannian geometry of Sobolev diffeomorphisms and their applications to shape analysis. In particular, it allows to introduce news co-adjoint variables and study new dynamics. We will discuss on some optimization problems that this  framework raises with some examples of half-Lie group actions

  title: Optimal Transport on the Lie Group of Roto-Translations
  abstract: >
    The roto-translation group SE(2) has been of active interest in image analysis due to methods that lift the image data to multi-orientation representations defined in this Lie group. This has led to impactful applications of crossing-preserving flows for image de-noising, geodesic tracking, and roto-translation equivariant deep learning. 
    In this talk, I will enumerate a computational framework for optimal transportation over Lie groups, with a special focus on SE(2). I will describe several theoretical aspects such as the non-optimality of group actions as transport maps, invariance and equivariance of optimal transport, and the quality of the entropic-regularized optimal transport plan using geodesic distance approximations. Finally, I will illustrate a Sinkhorn-like algorithm that can be efficiently implemented using fast and accurate distance approximations of the Lie group and GPU-friendly group convolutions. We report advancements with the experiments on 1) 2D shape/image barycenters, 2) interpolation of planar orientation fields, and 3) Wasserstein gradient flows on SE(2). We observe that our framework of lifting images to SE(2) and optimal transport with left-invariant anisotropic metrics leads to equivariant transport along dominant contours and salient line structures in the image and leads to meaningful interpolations compared to their counterparts on R^2.

  title: Data assimilation in shape spaces
  abstract: >
    Data assimilation aims to couple dynamic models of physical systems with available measurements in order to propose a case-specific, true digital twin of the observed physics. This field, originally developed in the 1970s for accurate predictions in environmental sciences, is now being extended to various fields, including engineering and life sciences. In this talk, we propose to adapt classical data assimilation formulations to deal with shape data defined in adapted space manifolds. We will present configurations where the state space in which the dynamics lives is a space manifold, or configurations where the partial observations are defined in a manifold, so that we can adapt our strategy to all cases of shape data assimilation. Finally, our approach will be illustrated by the assimilation of models taken from environmental sciences - in particular wildfire models - or from life sciences - in particular cardiovascular models.

  title: A Lagrangian method for fluids with free boundaries
  abstract: >
    In this presentation, I'll describe a numerical simulation method for free-surface fluids. I will start by giving an intuitive understanding of the physical phenomena involved in fluid dynamics, pressure, viscosity and surface tension. Then I will detail the numerical simulation method, based on the Gallouet-Mérigot numerical scheme, that describes the fluid as a set of cells, that can deform, but that keep a constant volume, and that follow the motion of the fluid (Lagrangian method). The constant volume constraint takes the form of a partial semi-discrete optimal transport. I will present the geometric and numerical aspects of this optimal transport problem.

  title: From cryo electron microscopy data to continuous conformational landscapes of biomolecules
  abstract: >
    The elucidation of different conformations of biomolecular complexes is the key for understanding the molecular mechanisms behind the biological functions of the complexes and the key to novel drug discovery. Single particle analysis (SPA) is a data collection and analysis technique of cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that allows 3D reconstruction of multiple conformations of purified biomolecular complexes from their 2D images. Another cryo-EM technique is cryo electron tomography (cryo-ET), which allows obtaining multiple conformations of the complexes in their cellular environment.
    Currently, one of the most important and challenging open problems in the cryo-EM field is how to obtain the entire, continuous conformational landscapes of the biomolecules from the data. Consequently, since a few years, methods development to solve this problem has been a very active research area. My group is developing such methods, by combining image processing, molecular dynamics simulations, and deep learning approaches. These methods are made available publicly via our open-source, ContinuousFlex software package, which can be run as a plugin of the broadly used Scipion software package. In this talk, I will present some of our most important achievements regarding this work.
