  title: Data assimilation in shape spaces
  abstract: >
    Data assimilation aims to couple dynamic models of physical systems with available measurements in order to propose a case-specific, true digital twin of the observed physics. This field, originally developed in the 1970s for accurate predictions in environmental sciences, is now being extended to various fields, including engineering and life sciences. In this talk, we propose to adapt classical data assimilation formulations to deal with shape data defined in adapted space manifolds. We will present configurations where the state space in which the dynamics lives is a space manifold, or configurations where the partial observations are defined in a manifold, so that we can adapt our strategy to all cases of shape data assimilation. Finally, our approach will be illustrated by the assimilation of models from the environmental sciences - in particular forest fire models - or the life sciences - in particular cardiovascular models.

  title: A Lagrangian method for fluids with free boundaries
  abstract: >
    In this presentation, I'll describe a numerical simulation method for free-surface fluids. I will start by giving an intuitive understanding of the physical phenomena involved in fluid dynamics, pressure, viscosity and surface tension. Then I will detail the numerical simulation method, based on the Gallouet-Mérigot numerical scheme, that describes the fluid as a set of cells, that can deform, but that keep a constant volume, and that follow the motion of the fluid (Lagrangian method). The constant volume constraint takes the form of a partial semi-discrete optimal transport. I will present the geometric and numerical aspects of this optimal transport problem.

  title: From cryo electron microscopy data to continuous conformational landscapes of biomolecules
  abstract: >
    The elucidation of different conformations of biomolecular complexes is the key for understanding the molecular mechanisms behind the biological functions of the complexes and the key to novel drug discovery. Single particle analysis (SPA) is a data collection and analysis technique of cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that allows 3D reconstruction of multiple conformations of purified biomolecular complexes from their 2D images. Another cryo-EM technique is cryo electron tomography (cryo-ET), which allows obtaining multiple conformations of the complexes in their cellular environment.
    Currently, one of the most important and challenging open problems in the cryo-EM field is how to obtain the entire, continuous conformational landscapes of the biomolecules from the data. Consequently, since a few years, methods development to solve this problem has been a very active research area. My group is developing such methods, by combining image processing, molecular dynamics simulations, and deep learning approaches. These methods are made available publicly via our open-source, ContinuousFlex software package, which can be run as a plugin of the broadly used Scipion software package. In this talk, I will present some of our most important achievements regarding this work.
