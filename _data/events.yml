  title: ICML 2023 Topological Deep Learning Challenge
  abstract: >
    The purpose of this challenge is to foster reproducible research in Topological Deep Learning by crowdsourcing the open-source implementation of neural networks on topological domains. Participants are asked to contribute code for a previously existing Topological Neural Network (TNN) and train it on a benchmark dataset.
    **Deadline for applications** is on July 13th, 2023.
