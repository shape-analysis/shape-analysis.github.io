    University of Vienna, Austria
  title: Infinite-dimensional Geometry - Theory and Applications
  abstract: >
    The aim of the project is to reinforce the collaboration between scientists from Austrian research institutions and international institutions around the topic of infinite dimensional geometry. Direct applications of the theoretical aspects of infinite dimensional geometry to shape analysis and medical imaging are part of the program. The programme will last five 5 weeks, each devoted to different topic ranging from abstract theoretical questions to very concrete applications (e.g. medical).

  title: ICML 2023 Topological Deep Learning Challenge
  abstract: >
    The purpose of this challenge is to foster reproducible research in Topological Deep Learning by crowdsourcing the open-source implementation of neural networks on topological domains. Participants are asked to contribute code for a previously existing Topological Neural Network (TNN) and train it on a benchmark dataset.
    **Deadline for applications** is on July 13th, 2023.
